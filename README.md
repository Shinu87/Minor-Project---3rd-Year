Project Overview
This repository explores the task of image captioning—generating natural language descriptions for images—using various deep learning methods. The project includes:
•	Data handling and preprocessing
•	Feature extraction using pre-trained CNNs (VGG16)
•	Implementation of multiple captioning architectures (RNN, GRU with Attention, Transformers, Reinforcement Learning)
•	Evaluation with standard metrics
 
Key Features
•	Multiple Models: Easily switch between RNN, GRU+Attention, Transformer, and RL-based architectures.
•	Clean Data Pipeline: Automated download and extraction of the Flickr8k dataset.
•	Transfer Learning: Uses VGG16 for image feature extraction.
•	Evaluation: Includes BLEU, METEOR, and ROUGE metrics.
•	Jupyter Notebooks: Step-by-step, well-commented code for easy experimentation.
 
Architectures Implemented
•	CNN + RNN: Classic encoder-decoder with VGG16 and RNN.
•	CNN + GRU + Attention: Adds attention mechanism for improved context.
•	CNN + Transformers: Leverages transformer decoders for sequence generation.
•	Reinforcement Learning: Optimizes captioning with RL-based reward signals.
 
Dataset
•	Flickr8k: Automatically downloaded and extracted by the code.
o	Images: Flicker8k_Dataset/
o	Captions: Flickr8k.token.txt
o	Train/Test/Validation splits provided.
 
Setup & Installation
Prerequisites
•	Python 3.7+
•	Jupyter Notebook
•	TensorFlow (2.x)
•	NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, nltk, tqdm, PIL, gdown, rouge-score
Installation Steps
1.	Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-captioning-models.git
cd image-captioning-models

2.	Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Or install manually:
pip install tensorflow numpy pandas matplotlib nltk tqdm pillow gdown rouge-score

3.	Start Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter notebook

Open the relevant notebook (e.g., CNN_GRU_attention.ipynb) and follow the instructions.
 
Usage
1.	Run the notebook:
Each notebook is self-contained and will guide you through:
o	Downloading and extracting the dataset
o	Preprocessing images and captions
o	Feature extraction
o	Training and evaluating the chosen model
2.	Modify parameters:
You can adjust batch size, image size, model hyperparameters, and dataset paths as needed.
